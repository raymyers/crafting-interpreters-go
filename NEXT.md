# Current State and Next Steps

## Current State

### What's Working
1. **Basic Evaluator Features**:
   - Arithmetic operations, comparisons, logical operations
   - Variables and scoping
   - Records and lists with spread operators
   - Lambda functions
   - Destructuring assignment
   - Basic perform/handle for simple effects (like Log)

2. **Log Effect**: 
   - Implemented as a builtin in the default scope
   - Works correctly with `perform Log("message")`

3. **Simplified Effect Handling**:
   - VisitPerform looks up effects in scope or effectHandlers map
   - VisitHandle installs handlers and tracks performed effects
   - Works for simple cases without resumption

### What's Not Working
1. **Full Algebraic Effects with Resumption**:
   - The Handle test expects proper continuation capture
   - Current implementation doesn't capture the continuation at perform sites
   - Can't properly implement the `resume` function that continues execution

2. **Current Handle Test Failure**:
   ```
   Expected: {return: {}, alerts: ["first", "second"]}
   Actual: {return: {}, alerts: []}
   ```
   - The performed effects are being tracked but not properly passed to the handler
   - The resume function isn't capturing and restoring the execution context

## Technical Challenges

### The Core Problem
The test case requires:
```lox
handle Alert(|value, resume| {
    {return: return, alerts: alerts} = resume({})
    {return: return, alerts: [value, ..alerts]}
  },
  |_| {alerts: [], return: exec({})}
)
```

The `resume` parameter needs to:
1. Continue execution from where `perform Alert(...)` was called
2. Capture any subsequent alerts
3. Return the final result with all alerts collected

### Why It's Hard in a Recursive Evaluator
- Recursive evaluators use the language's call stack
- Can't easily capture and restore the call stack (continuation)
- Would need to either:
  1. Convert to CPS (Continuation Passing Style)
  2. Use an explicit stack machine (like the reference implementation)
  3. Use a delimited continuation library (not available in Go)

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Minimal Implementation (Current Path)
- Keep the current simplified implementation
- Document that full algebraic effects aren't supported
- The Log effect and other simple effects work fine
- Handle test would need to be skipped or modified

### Option 2: Stack Machine Conversion
- Convert entire evaluator to use explicit stack (like reference implementation)
- Major rewrite but would support full algebraic effects
- Steps:
  1. Define stack frame types (Apply, Arg, Assign, Delimit, etc.)
  2. Convert recursive evaluation to iterative with explicit stack
  3. Implement perform/handle with proper continuation capture

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Keep recursive evaluator for most operations
- Use explicit stack only for effect handling
- More complex but less invasive

### Option 4: Simplified Effect System
- Modify the language semantics to not require full continuations
- Effects could return values directly without resume
- Would need to change the Handle test expectations

## Code State
- Fixed compilation errors by removing undefined pushFrame/popFrame calls
- evaluator.go compiles but Handle test still fails
- Current implementation tracks performed effects but doesn't properly invoke handlers with continuations

## Recommendation
Given the complexity of implementing full algebraic effects in a recursive evaluator, I recommend either:
1. Accepting the limitation and documenting it
2. Committing to a full stack machine rewrite if algebraic effects are critical

The reference implementation shows it's possible but requires a fundamentally different evaluation strategy.
